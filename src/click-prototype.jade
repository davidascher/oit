h4 Detailed steps
ol
  li <strong>DEFINE</strong>: an idea to develop that you have already storyboarded and know in broad strokes how should work.
  li <strong>PLAN</strong>: From your storyboard start to flesh out what the product experience would look like to deliver on your experience. What interactions would the user need to have, where does your product end and real life begin? What are the questions you have, the assumptions you are making in this? Draw out the interaction screens you would need and show the links between them the user would be able to make. A system diagram is a great tool to use for this in the planning phase.
  li <strong>CREATE</strong>:
    ol
      li sketch out all your main interaction screens on paper
      li create them one by one in the keynote. Using tools such as keynote templates allows you to do this with no design skills.
      li add interactivity by connecting the buttons needed with links following the diagram you created in the planning phase.
      li Export to PDF (with links) or test in present mode.
  li <strong>SHARE & TEST</strong>: You are now ready to reap the benefits of prototyping your solutions early on. Test the prototype with real users (preferably your target audience) and get early feedback from stakeholders
