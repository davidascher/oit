    div.card-text Storyboarding is a sequential narrative of the user's interaction with your product. It is useful in several stages of the product development process:

        li Early phases: Making early ideas concrete and helps with the feature articulation.
        li Later phases:  Provides a reality check of the interactions, coherence, and flow.
        li Throughout: it also can act as an alignment tool and also surfaces important parts of the experience that lie outside the product interaction. Partnerships or other accommodations may be needed to support these.

h4 Detailed steps (for early idea storyboarding)
ol
  li <strong>DEFINE</strong>: pick your focus, either on a problem, or a set of ideas.
  li <strong>PLAN</strong>: Individually give people time to think about the idea and how a experience could work. Think about the beginning, middle, and end of the experience. Mindmapping can be useful at this stage, as can loads of post it’s. This should take about 5 min each.
  li <strong>CREATE</strong>: Give each person a A4 white paper and fold it across and then three times vertically to create 6 boxes (or just draw them). Give each person a pen and ask them to draw out how they think the idea being considered should work. (this is not about high fidelity or being an artist, everyone can join in)
  li <strong>SHARE</strong>: Ask everyone to hang their storyboards on the wall and share their ideas. When things are clarified capture them on post it’s and add to the boards.
  li <strong>PRIORITISE</strong>: Give everyone 2-3 small stickers and ask them to vote for their favorite board and/or pieces of the experience that they like.
  li <strong>CONSOLIDATE</strong>: In a group move the top voted boards up to a big wall.  Talk in the group about the top voted boards and sections; what was important? why was it important? how do the fit together? Build out a larger storyboard on a wall that starts to consolidate the best items from the top voted boards and build out a best-in-class storyboard.
