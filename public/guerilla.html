Get written commitment from subject (non-binding but symbolic). </li><li>PLAN: Activities can be participating in a interview (remote/in person), completing a daily survey, creating a diary entry, sending a text message/response, taking photographs, recording a video. </li><li>CONDUCT: Start cohort at the same time (ideal but not necessary). Be prepared to respond quickly to any questions or concerns from the subjects. Leverage every opportunity to build rapport and press deeper with the subjects. Document all correspondences throughout the process.</li><li>SYNTHESIZE: With a full understanding of each user response and behavior, take time to soon after your last interview to review your data and start synthesizing it into insight.  Extract key findings: what was surprising or unexpected? What assumptions were confirmed? Use anomalies and edge cases to push your own product concept. Avoid confirmation bias by forcing yourself to move beyond your current product concept. Ensure your team is represented, multidisciplinary backgrounds give different perspectives and see opportunities and challenges better.</li><li>COMMUNICATE: Create a concise summary document that is useful to you first and foremost, and can also be used to keep stakeholders up to date.</li></ol><h4>Incentive</h4><p>$50-100 gift card for 1-2 hours of activity</p><h4>Degree of Difficulty</h4><p>Medium - High</p><p>Source: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jNexiHfRuSKk1VoDt6hqx5GiVQDa9J5vZ0Bnpipu7Jw/edit?ts=56ddf09b">Guerilla Research</a></p><h3 class="p-t-2 discussion">Discussion</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>(function() { // DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
