Think about the beginning, middle, and end of the experience. Mindmapping can be useful at this stage, as can loads of post it’s. This should take about 5 min each.</li><li><strong>CREATE</strong>: Give each person a A4 white paper and fold it across and then three times vertically to create 6 boxes (or just draw them). Give each person a pen and ask them to draw out how they think the idea being considered should work. (this is not about high fidelity or being an artist, everyone can join in)</li><li><strong>SHARE</strong>: Ask everyone to hang their storyboards on the wall and share their ideas. When things are clarified capture them on post it’s and add to the boards.</li><li><strong>PRIORITISE</strong>: Give everyone 2-3 small stickers and ask them to vote for their favorite board and/or pieces of the experience that they like.</li><li><strong>CONSOLIDATE</strong>: In a group move the top voted boards up to a big wall.  Talk in the group about the top voted boards and sections; what was important? why was it important? how do the fit together? Build out a larger storyboard on a wall that starts to consolidate the best items from the top voted boards and build out a best-in-class storyboard.</li></ol><p>Refer to the <a href="/system-thinking">System Thinking / Visual Collaboration Workshop</a> to expand this further.</p><h4>Degree of Difficulty</h4><p>Low</p><h3 class="p-t-2 discussion">Discussion</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>(function() { // DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
