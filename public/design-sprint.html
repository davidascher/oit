The concept is based on d.school/IDEO design thinking and was evolved and strengthen by Google Ventures to become a standard practice.</p><div class="card"><div class="card-header"> <h6>Objective</h6></div><div class="card-block"><div class="card-text"> Getting unstuck or accelerating projects </div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header"><h6>Outcome</h6></div><div class="card-block"><div class="card-text"> <ul><li>Rich and shared understanding of a strong user need to address</li><li>User-centered solutions that are technically feasible and business viable</li><li>Differentiated and interesting solutions that have been vetted with real users and refined</li><li>Stronger problem-solving muscles</li><li>Bonded team mates and sense of accomplishment</li></ul></div></div></div><h4>Time</h4><ul><li>1 week of prep</li><li>1-5 days to conduct the sprint</li><li>1 week of synthesis and documentation</li></ul><h4>Number of people needed</h4><p>2 facilitators, and a notetaker/documenter (responsible for planning and synthesis)</p><p>8-12 participants</p><h4>Equipment/materials/space</h4><ul><li>One consistent bright, large, and energized space with whiteboards, wall space to hang things, and workspaces for participants</li><li>Materials include whiteboards and markers, sharpies, postits, large sticky notes, colored paper, scissors, colored pens</li><li>Depending on the length and depth of the sprint, tools like Keynote or Balsamiq may be used to create an interactive prototype</li></ul><h4>Detailed steps</h4><ol><li><b>Preparation</b>: Make sure all participants can attend for 100% of the time; Share any market and user research ahead of time; introduce participants to each other; briefly describe any project history. </li><li><b>Understand</b>: Dig into the user problem through <a href="/research">research, <a href="/competitive">competitive review</a>, and strategy exercises. To get the most out of this allow for people with multidisciplinary backgrounds to give a brief overview of the opportunity area from their perspectives. Work on collectively analyzing the research, playing with competitors products, sharing anecdotes, discussing adjacent product/service experiences or metaphors. </a></li><li><b>Diverge/Sketch</b>: Rapidly develop as many solutions as possible first individually and then collectively through a series of structured <a href="/ideation">ideation exercises</a>.</li><li><b>Converge/Decide</b>: Choose the best ideas or clusters of ideas by discussing, combining, critiquing, and voting. Further elaborate and evolve by creating the user story through storyboarding and other exercises.	</li><li><b>Prototype</b> : Build something quick and dirty that can be shown to users. Depending on the length of sprint, this may take the form of a simple model or an interactive prototype. When interactive, the prototypes are meant to engage test users in key interactions, not prove any engineering feats.</li><li><b>Validate</b>: Show the prototype to real users to learn what works and what doesnâ€™t. Listen closely, this is a learning moment</li></ol><p>Recommend deep dive into the Product Design Sprint:</p><ul> <li>Product focus: <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">http://www.gv.com/sprint/</a></li><li>UX focus: <a href="http://www.tandemseven.com/blog/ux-agile-run-product-design-sprint/">http://www.tandemseven.com/blog/ux-agile-run-product-design-sprint/</a></li></ul><h4>Degree of Difficulty</h4><p>High (needs a trained facilitator and planning time) - reach out at open.innovation@mozilla.com</p><h3 class="p-t-2 discussion">Discussion</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>(function() { // DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
