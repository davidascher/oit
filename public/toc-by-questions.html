Check out our <a href="/methods">research section</a> for a few simple ways to engage friends, colleagues, family, strangers in productive conversation.</li><li>Will your implementation of the feature meet user needs? Best to prototype rapidly. Check out our <a href="/prototyping-methods">prototype section</a>, especially <a href="/paper-prototype">paper prototypes</a> and <a href="/storyboarding">storyboarding</a></li></ul><h4>I am interested in a particular user problem, how do I get started in creating a solution?</h4><ul><li>First, make sure you understand the problem you want to solve by talking to people and observing their behaviors. Check out our <a href="/methods">research section</a>, especially <a href="/recruit">Interviewing 101</a> and <a href="/guerilla">Guerilla Research</a></li><li>Grab a few colleagues and practice divergent thinking to come up with a novel solution: Check out our <a href="/workshops">workshops</a> section, especially <a href="/feature-ideation">Feature Ideation / User Need Workshop</a>.</li></ul><h4>What are the methods to run an ideation session to get new thinking on my product?</h4><ul><li>Check out our <a href="/workshops">workshops</a> section, especially <a href="/ideation">Idea Generation</a> and <a href="/codesign">Participatory Design/Co-design Worksession</a>. </li><li>Feel free to consult with the Innovation Team to get additional tips tuned to your particular situation and product.</li></ul><h4>How can I create a meaningful prototype without coding?</h4><p>Maximum return/minimum effort! Try quick light-weight tests to make sure you’re on the right path: In the <a href="/prototyping-methods">prototype section</a>, focus especially on <a href="/paper-prototype">paper prototypes</a> and <a href="/click-prototype">Click-through / interactive prototype</a>.</p><h4>How can I uncover problems? ("I have this solution, tell me what the right problem is for it")</h4><ul><li>We need to shift our mindset at Mozilla to understand that technology-first solutions are inherently limited. By developing empathy for our users (not just makers!), building solutions for real-world non-frivolous problems, and striving to create meaningful value propositions not just technical achievements, we will be able to make enormous positive impact on people’s lives. </li><li>In terms of employing specific methods, focus on surfacing insights of real people by making observations and asking questions. Check out the <a href="/methods">research section</a>, especially <a href="/recruit">Interviewing 101</a> and <a href="/guerilla">Guerilla Research</a>.</li></ul><h4>How can we build user feedback loops into our development process so we can learn and iterate quickly?</h4><p>As part of the innovation process currently applied in Connected Devices “Trains,” we are encouraging the creation of meaningful “milestone” checkins based on the product roadmap and MVP plan. The team should extract milestones every 2-4 weeks. </p><p>Milestones are measurable activities in several categories: user engagement, operations, engineering, communication. (Continuous user engagement is critical to product success and needs to be treated on par with other management practices.) Examples of milestones include: onboard new mobile engineer, share learnings on implementation Y with other teams, interview # experts, release feature X, dogfood in Z location. </p><p>These milestones help act as guideposts of progress and are the core to communication around progress between the team and the Product Innovation Board. The milestones are not just way to check in on the team’s progress, but they give the board and PM a chance to help the teams through resourcing, introductions, and other support.</p><h4>How do we prototype, workshop, and innovate while being remote?</h4><p>Remote teams need to work harder to be in sync, yet fight off the tendency to over-schedule meetings. The best advice for teams working remotely on innovation processes is to establish habit and focus on communication. </p><p><strong>Habit</strong>: daily standups and monthly face-to-face meetings; all member engage with real world users (X# of interviews/observations/brainstorms a week). </p><p><strong>Communication</strong>: structuring contributions so that people share learnings not just accomplishments. </p><p>[Need a better answer here from someone with a remote perspective. - Emma to give input]</p><h4>How can I size a target market? </h4><p>Generally there are two ways of defining a target market size: bottom up and top down. Bottom up is considered a more reliable method and one we recommend also. Bottom up approach requires you first to define your target customer and then estimating how many of them you can reach, and how many of the ones you can reach will buy your product.

We do this by defining not just the type of person, but the problem we are solving and why the target customer is interested in having that problem solved.
