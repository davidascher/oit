For us, innovation is not just about
breakout products that support the open web, it’s about how we make those
products – with transparency, communication, and a participatory approach.
</p><p>This innovation toolkit is designed to empower each and every person at
Mozilla with a set of tried and true methods to move us forward in building the
products that support our mission. The toolkit currently focuses on the earlier
part of product development around insight gathering, ideation, and rapid
prototyping. This upfront work should flow into a more established product
development process.
</p><p>Each activity includes pertinent information around purpose, outcome, time,
number of people needed, difficulty, equipment/materials/space, and detailed
steps. We have also linked out to articles and blog posts that describe methods
in a way we consider to be a best practice. Our goal is to create a collection
that leverages our internal knowledge and takes advantage of the great work
others have contributed in the field.
</p><p>The Open Innovation Team has a “train the trainer” mindset where our goal is
to enable and empower other Mozillians to deploy these methods. However we know
that is it is sometimes more expedient or preferable to have experienced
facilitators run a particular session -- in this case the Innovation Team will
happily support the team directly.  Ask for a facilitator, email us at:

</p><p>The Mozilla manifesto pledges the organization to build and deliver great consumer products that support that manifesto's principles. To do that, we will work by the following product principles:
</p><h3 class="p-y-2 display-4">Product Principles</h3><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item">We will build products that solve challenges real users face.</li><li class="list-group-item">We will obsessively seek to understand these user challenges by bringing empathy, cultural awareness, and fairness to every challenge.</li><li class="list-group-item">We will not fall in love with the solutions we create, but instead keep our focus on the problems we are trying to solve. We know that there are myriad solutions to a problem, but a solution can only be right or wrong.</li><li class="list-group-item">We will use our muscles to build only after we have uncovered insights, generated multiple ideas, and rapidly prototyped and tested possible solutions.</li><li class="list-group-item">We will take pride in our work but remember that we are building for users, not just ourselves.</li><li class="list-group-item">We will create unique and defensible products with value propositions that are driven by the market.</li></ul><h3 class="p-t-2 discussion">Discussion</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>(function() { // DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
