Make sure you have incentive ready.</li><li><strong>PLAN</strong>: Build out an interview guide, activity guide (this is not a script, interviews should be conversations and your guide is just to keep you on track, not to read from). </li><li><strong>CONDUCT</strong>: On the day, ensure you have a notetaker for the interviews. Before interviewing read through our 101 guide for interviewing. Start the interview with an introduction. Open up with easy questions and draw out to specifics. Avoid asking leading questions, use storytelling techniques such as; tell me the last time you did X, tell me about how a normal day is for you, show me how you do something.  Listen carefully, take notes. Audio record and take pictures. </li><li><strong>SYNTHESIZE</strong>: With a full understanding of each user response and behavior, take time to soon after your last interview to review your data and start synthesizing it into insight.  Extract key findings: what was surprising or unexpected? What assumptions were confirmed? Use anomalies and edge cases to push your own product concept. Avoid confirmation bias by forcing yourself to move beyond your current product concept. Ensure your team is represented, multidisciplinary backgrounds give different perspectives and see opportunities and challenges better.</li><li><strong>COMMUNICATE</strong>: Create a concise summary document that is useful to you first and foremost, and can also be used to keep stakeholders up to date.</li></ol><h4>Incentives</h4><ul><li>1 hour interviews in person ~$150 pr person</li><li>1 hour interviews remote ~$100 pr person</li></ul><h4>Degree of Difficulty</h4><p>Medium - High</p><h3 class="p-t-2 discussion">Discussion</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>(function() { // DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
