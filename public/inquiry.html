Define the tasks you are interested in observing (can be do x, but also just follow for a day of working). Plan and prepare questions to ask around the tasks you are interested in observing. Record your findings (video, photos, notes), especially contextual enquiry can be difficult to observe in real time and often requires revisiting one's notes and recordings.</li><li><strong>CONDUCT</strong>: Go to where observations will take place, introduce yourself and goal of research. Ask participants to do the tasks in a normal way and observe in a non-intrusive manner. Ask questions at opportune moments and try to stay in the background as much as possible. The goal is to try to get them comfortable with you being there so they don’t completely change their way of doing things.</li><li><strong>SYNTHESIZE</strong>: Debrief on the observations. With a full understanding of each participant's behavior, synthesize all observations and create patterns over time to understand a blended (but not “normalized”) picture. Extract key findings: what was surprising or unexpected? What assumptions were confirmed? Use anomalies and edge cases to push your own product concept. Avoid confirmation bias by forcing yourself to move beyond your current product concept. Ensure your team is represented, multidisciplinary backgrounds give different perspectives and see opportunities and challenges better.</li><li><strong>COMMUNICATE</strong>: Create a concise summary document that is useful to you first and foremost, and can also be used to keep stakeholders up to date.</li></ol><br><h4>Incentive (pending socio-economic status)</h4><p>$150/person</p><h4>Degree of Difficulty</h4><p>Medium - High</p><h3 class="p-t-2 discussion">Discussion</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>(function() { // DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
