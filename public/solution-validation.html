What about the how do you have questions about? What do you want to understand more about? Where did you make assumptions you are unsure of? Write down your questions and come up with a prototype that can test those questions.</li><li><strong>BUILD</strong>: your prototype. Do this as early and fast to get feedback as quickly as possible, by creating clickable prototypes and paper prototypes.</li><li><strong>RECRUIT</strong>: people to test it on. Ideally recruit for people who have the problem you are solving for. But especially in the early days, just getting people to try your solution and see if it works will be helpful.</li><li><strong>CONDUCT</strong>: Let testers know this is a prototype and so not a finished product. The goal is not to test them but to test the prototype. Present your prototype to users, you can frame the task, but avoid guiding them. Think out-loud testing is extremely useful in prototype evaluation, so ask users to voice everything they think as they go through your prototype. They may need reminding, so ask often “what are you thinking right now?”. Observe where they have problems, why they have problems. Same rules as for general interviews apply.</li><li><strong>LEARN & REPEAT</strong>: As your product advanced in development you can advance the prototype techniques you are using and target more in on the people you test with.</li><li><strong>COMMUNICATE</strong>: Create a concise summary document that is useful to you first and foremost, and can also be used to keep stakeholders up to date.</li></ol><h4>Degree of Difficulty</h4><p>Medium</p><h3 class="p-t-2 discussion">Discussion</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>(function() { // DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
